# AVARA Development Logs

This log tracks all actions taken, what worked, and what failed during the development of AVARA.

## [2026-02-26] - Initial Setup & Documentation
**Actions:**
- Analyzed the authoritative specification in `AVARA.md`.
- Generated `README.md` for quick development reference.
- Created this `dev_logs.md` file.
- Generated `task.md` and `implementation_plan.md` artifacts.

**What Worked:**
- Successfully extracted the core tenets and architecture into actionable developer guidelines.

**What Failed:**
- N/A.

## [2026-02-26] - Phase 1: Control (MVP)
**Actions:**
- Implemented `ToolGuard` and `ToolRegistry` for explicit tool execution validation (`src/guards/tool_guard.py`).
- Implemented `CircuitBreaker` to halt high-risk actions pending approval (`src/guards/circuit_breaker.py`).
- Implemented `AuditLedger` for immutable, replayable logging (`src/core/audit_ledger.py`).
- Created and passed integration tests (`test_phase1.py`).

**What Worked:**
- Isolation of guards allows them to be tested independently. Simulated approvals correctly halted execution.
- JSON-based structured logging for the Audit Ledger works smoothly for mock replayability.

**What Failed:**
- N/A.

## [2026-02-26] - Phase 2: Governance
**Actions:**
- Implemented `IAMService` for Agent Identity provision and validation (`src/core/iam_service.py`).
- Implemented `RAGFirewall` for document provenance, ACL enforcement, and instruction poisoning detection (`src/guards/rag_firewall.py`).
- Implemented `IntentValidator` to detect semantic drift between task intent and agent action (`src/guards/intent_validator.py`).
- Created and passed integration tests (`test_phase2.py`).

**What Worked:**
- Agent identity scoping prevents anonymous execution effectively.
- RAG firewall successfully quarantined mocked instruction poisoning attempts ("IGNORE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS").

**What Failed:**
- Initially, the ACL logic in the RAG Firewall was flawed (it allowed access to any document if the document permitted 'admin', regardless of the user's role). This was caught by tests and fixed.
- Initially, the Intent Validator mock logic didn't align precisely with the tests (expected `analyze` vs `parse`). Caught by tests and fixed.

---

## [2026-02-26] - Phase 3: Emergence Control
**Actions:**
- Implemented `MultiAgentMonitor` to trap unsafe message recomposition and unverified assumption propagation (`src/guards/multi_agent_monitor.py`).
- Implemented `ContextGovernor` to strictly enforce token budgets and preserve safety anchors (`src/guards/context_governor.py`).
- Implemented `AnomalyDetector` to heuristically identify rapid execution rates and repetitive failures (`src/guards/anomaly_detector.py`).
- Created and passed integration tests (`test_phase3.py`).

**What Worked:**
- The Context Governor correctly blocked context saturation while preserving the non-negotiable safety constraints.
- The Anomaly detector effectively caught automated scanning attempts based on rapid heuristic checks.

**What Failed:**
- N/A.

---

## [2026-02-26] - Phase 4: API Layer & Extensibility
**Actions:**
- Designed and initialized a FastAPI service (`src/api/server.py`) serving as the central AVARA authority capable of intercepting requests over the network.
- Setup Python `venv` and installed dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `requests`, `pydantic`).
- Created SQLite-backed `PersistentStore` (`src/db/persistent_store.py`) to persist IAM identities, tool registrations, and anomaly history.
- Wrote integration tests (`test_phase4.py`) simulating a REST payload.
- Wrote an example integration adapter (`src/api/framework_adapter.py`) showcasing how agent frameworks like crewAI or LangGraph intercept LLM commands before execution.

**What Worked:**
- Dependencies successfully installed. Test script correctly queried the local FastAPI instance, validating endpoints worked with the inner guard systems and enforcing unauthorized revocation.

**What Failed:**
- Minor Bash environment hiccup on the MAC testing server requiring explicit `venv` configuration over global Homebrew packages, easily solved using standard `python3 -m venv` commands.
